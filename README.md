# youtubeDownloader Using Python And Tkinter✌✌✌✌
Youtube Downloader is a simple exe file which can be installed by the users. User's can Download single video from youtube and also can list out any Playlist from Youtube.

I used the following Libraries in Python3:

✔ 1- Tkinter ✔ 2- Pytube ✔ 3- Pyinstaller

I used Inno Setup Compiler software to generate the executable setup file of the Python Script. Download Link:https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php
